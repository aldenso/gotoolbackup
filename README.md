gotoolbackup
============

Program to create backups using toml file, where you indicate origin and destiny directories and retention period in days.

TODO: use external tomlfile, use flags to indicate if you want to erase original files or not, also I need to separate some files for readability.

Note: this is not for replacing shell scripts or anything else, is just to practice some golang and learn how to use tar and gzip packages, backups times are not bad but it could be better.
